# Facial_key_points_recognition

This project was built using the dataset from the facial key points detection Project from [Udemy Nano degree: Become a Computer Vision Expert](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) .

The dataset consists of images of faces with *68 keypoints* (x,y coordinates) that depict the **facial features** like *eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, face outline*. 
We train a *Convolutional Neural Network* to detect the facial keypoints for the image input given.

Transfer Learning was applied on a pretrained **DenseNet121** model available in tf.Keras to predict the facial keypoint coordinates. I have experimented by keeping all the layers in the densenet model trainable, except the last convolutional layer and also by keeping all the layers trainable. The later performed better of the 2 models.
