# Facial_key_points_recognition

This project was built using the dataset from the facial key points detection Project from [Udemy Nano degree: Become a Computer Vision Expert](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) .

The dataset consists of images of faces with *68 keypoints*(x,y coordinates) that depict the **facial features** like *eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, face outline*. 
We train a *Convolutional Neural Network* to detect the facial keypoints for the image input given.
